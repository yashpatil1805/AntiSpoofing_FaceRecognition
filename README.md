# AntiSpoofing_FaceRecognition
Anti-Spoofing Face Recognition Using YOLO This project implements an anti-spoofing face recognition system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The system is designed to distinguish between real and fake faces in real-time, providing a robust defense against spoofing attacks such as photo, video, or mask-based impersonation attempts
