# AntiSpoofing_FaceRecognition
Anti-Spoofing Face Recognition Using YOLO This project implements an anti-spoofing face recognition system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The system is designed to distinguish between real and fake faces in real-time, providing a robust defense against spoofing attacks such as photo, video, or mask-based impersonation attempts
Key features include:

Dataset Preparation: Automatic splitting of data into training, validation, and test sets, with proper formatting for YOLO training.
Model Training: Training a YOLOv8 model for binary classification of real and fake faces.
Real-Time Detection: Running the trained model to perform live anti-spoofing detection using a webcam or video input.
Features
Real-Time Face Detection with Anti-Spoofing:

Detects faces and classifies them as either real or fake.
Provides bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores on a live video feed.
Dataset Management:

The splitData.py script prepares the dataset by splitting it into train, val, and test sets.
Generates a data.yaml configuration file for YOLO model training.

Model Training:

The train.py script uses the YOLOv8 framework to train a custom anti-spoofing model on labeled datasets.
Scripts Overview
main.py:

Real-time anti-spoofing face recognition script.
Uses a trained YOLO model (nano_100.pt) for live classification of faces as real or fake.
splitData.py:

Automates the process of splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Ensures that image-label pairs remain consistent and prepares the dataset for YOLO training.
train.py:

Trains a YOLOv8 model for the anti-spoofing face recognition task.
Configures the training process using the data.yaml file generated by splitData.py.
